# CoRT (Chain of Recursive Thoughts) ðŸ§ ðŸ”„

## TL;DR: I made my AI think harder by making it argue with itself repeatedly. It works stupidly well.

### What is this?
CoRT makes AI models recursively think about their responses, generate alternatives, and pick the best one. It's like giving the AI the ability to doubt itself and try again... and again... and again, using the OpenRouter API.

### Does it actually work?
YES. Tests with models like Mistral 7B Instruct show significant improvement in task performance (e.g., programming) compared to direct generation. Performance varies by model.

## How it works
1.  User provides input.
2.  AI (via the script) estimates how many "thinking rounds" it needs based on the input's complexity.
3.  AI generates an initial response.
4.  For each thinking round:
    *   Generates alternative responses (e.g., 2 alternatives).
    *   Evaluates the current best response against the alternatives.
    *   Picks the best one (which might be the current best or an alternative).
5.  The final response is the survivor of this iterative refinement process.

## Try it yourself

1.  **Clone/Download:** Get the code into a local directory.
    ```bash
    # Example if using git
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** (Recommended)
    *   Navigate into the project directory in your terminal.
    *   Create the environment (common name is `venv`):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```cmd
        .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
        *(Note: You might need to adjust PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`)*
    *   Your terminal prompt should change to indicate the active environment (e.g., `(venv) your-prompt $`).

4.  **Install Dependencies:** (While the venv is active)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set API Key:**
   Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=xxxx` in your .env if you want to store it there or...

    ```bash
    # Recommended: Set environment variable (Linux/macOS)
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    # Or Windows (Command Prompt)
    # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    # Or Windows (PowerShell)
    # $env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    ```
    *Alternatively, the script will prompt you if the environment variable is not found.*

6.  **Run the Script:** (Make sure your venv is still active!)
    ```bash
    # Use python3 or python depending on your system/venv setup
    python3 recursive-thinking-ai.py
    ```

7.  **Interact:** Chat with the AI!
    *   Type `save` to save the current conversation history.
    *   Type `save log` to save the detailed thinking log for all interactions in the session.
    *   Type `exit` to quit.

8.  **Deactivate (When Done):**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

### The Secret Sauce
The magic is in:
*   **Self-Correction/Refinement:** The core loop of generating, evaluating, and selecting.
*   **Competitive Alternatives:** Forcing the generation of different approaches.
*   **Iterative Improvement:** Building on the best response from the previous round.
*   **Dynamic Thinking Depth:** Adapting the number of rounds based on perceived complexity.
