      "content": "To determine the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 2:15 pm, we'll analyze the positions of each hand relative to the 12 o'clock position and then find the smallest angle between them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Position of the Minute Hand\n\n- The minute hand moves **6 degrees per minute** (since $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{60} = 6^\\circ $).\n- At 15 minutes, the minute hand is at:\n  $$\n  15 \\times 6 = 90^\\circ\n  $$\n  from the 12 o'clock position.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Position of the Hour Hand\n\n- The hour hand moves **0.5 degrees per minute** (since $ \\frac{30^\\circ}{60} = 0.5^\\circ $).\n- At 2:15, the hour hand has passed the 2 (which is at $ 2 \\times 30 = 60^\\circ $) and is now a quarter of the way to the 3.\n- The additional movement due to 15 minutes is:\n  $$\n  15 \\times 0.5 = 7.5^\\circ\n  $$\n- So, the hour hand is at:\n  $$\n  60 + 7.5 = 67.5^\\circ\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Angle Between the Hands\n\n- The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions:\n  $$\n  |90 - 67.5| = 22.5^\\circ\n  $$\n\n- Since the angle between clock hands is always the **smaller** of the two possible angles, and 22.5Â° is less than 180Â°, this is our final answer.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Formula for Verification\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands at any time can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Angle} = |30H - 5.5M|\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ H $ is the hour (2 in this case),\n- $ M $ is the minutes (15 in this case).\n\n$$\n\\text{Angle} = |30 \\times 2 - 5.5 \\times 15| = |60 - 82.5| = 22.5^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{22.5}\n$$"
