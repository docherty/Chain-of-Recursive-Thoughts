          "response": "To find the angle between the hour and minute hands at 2:15, let's break it down using a **visual and conceptual approach** rather than strict arithmetic formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Visualizing the Clock Face**\n\nA clock is a circle divided into 12 hours, so each hour represents **30 degrees** (since $ 360^\\circ \\div 12 = 30^\\circ $). At 2:15, the **minute hand** points at the **3**, which is exactly **90 degrees** from the 12 oâ€™clock position (since each number represents 30 degrees, and 3 Ã— 30 = 90). \n\nMeanwhile, the **hour hand** is **partway between the 2 and the 3**. At 2:00, itâ€™s exactly at **60 degrees** (2 Ã— 30). But by 2:15, it has moved forward as time passes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Movement of the Hour Hand**\n\nThe hour hand moves **0.5 degrees per minute** (since $ 30^\\circ \\div 60 = 0.5^\\circ $). In 15 minutes, it moves:\n$$\n15 \\times 0.5 = 7.5^\\circ\n$$\nSo, at 2:15, the hour hand is at:\n$$\n60^\\circ + 7.5^\\circ = 67.5^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **3. Calculating the Angle Between the Hands**\n\nNow, the **minute hand** is at **90Â°**, and the **hour hand** is at **67.5Â°**. The angle between them is the **absolute difference**:\n$$\n|90^\\circ - 67.5^\\circ| = 22.5^\\circ\n$$\n\nSince the angle between clock hands is always the **smaller of the two possible angles**, and 22.5Â° is less than 180Â°, this is the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Intuitive Check: Relative Speed**\n\nThe **minute hand** moves **6 degrees per minute**, and the **hour hand** moves **0.5 degrees per minute**. So, the **minute hand gains 5.5 degrees per minute** on the hour hand. At 2:00, the angle between them is **60Â°** (since the hour hand is at 2 and the minute at 12). By 2:15, the minute hand has gained:\n$$\n15 \\times 5.5 = 82.5^\\circ\n$$\nBut this gain **reduces** the initial 60Â° gap. The new angle is:\n$$\n60^\\circ - 82.5^\\circ = -22.5^\\circ\n$$\nTaking the absolute value gives **22.5Â°**, confirming our result.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{22.5^\\circ}\n$$",

          "response": "To determine the angle between the hour and minute hands at 2:15 PM, we can approach the problem by first converting the time into a unified unitâ€”**minutes**â€”and then calculating each handâ€™s position relative to the clock face. This method simplifies the calculation by treating both hands as moving based on the same time unit.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert Time to Total Minutes Since 12:00  \nAt 2:15 PM, the total time elapsed since 12:00 is:  \n$$\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} + 15 \\text{ minutes} = 135 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Hour Handâ€™s Position  \nThe hour hand moves **0.5 degrees per minute** (since $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{12 \\times 60} = 0.5^\\circ $).  \n$$\n\\text{Hour hand position} = 135 \\times 0.5 = 67.5^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Minute Handâ€™s Position  \nThe minute hand moves **6 degrees per minute** (since $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{60} = 6^\\circ $).  \n$$\n\\text{Minute hand position} = 15 \\times 6 = 90^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the Absolute Difference  \n$$\n\\text{Angle between hands} = |90 - 67.5| = 22.5^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Confirm the Smaller Angle  \nSince 22.5Â° is less than 180Â°, it is the smaller angle between the hands. If the calculation had resulted in an angle greater than 180Â°, we would subtract it from 360Â° to find the smaller angle.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer  \n$$\n\\boxed{22.5}\n$$",
